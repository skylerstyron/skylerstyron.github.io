					<p align="center">Harvest House is one of my local bars. I have been going here for a few years and have always loved the environment and friendly staff. Their website was the opposite of what the bar/venue was actually like: very messy, not a lot of info, and a low quality single image background that made the text hard to read. I had created a few mock ups and decided to pitch the idea of redesigning the website to the GM and owner. <br><br>The initial design that I pitched was nowhere near the direction that I went but it was much cleaner than their original site.</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<p align="center">My goal was to create a clean, minimal site that stayed true to their brand and over all feel of the venue. Two other main points of mine were to include an Event List that pulled from their Facebook events, along with a menu. Both were missing from their previous website. <br><br>I was able to work very closely with the owner and GM throughout the process, in order to create a website that shows what Harvest House really is. I basically sat down with the owner and interviewed him and got to know the full story of Harvest House. From that, I was able to form sections that would be included in the copy (my wife is an amazing writer, she wrote most of everything).</p>

					<p align="center">The Experience page was something that I wanted to make to summarize what Harvest House has to offer. I have plans for creating a video that will go on this page as well. All images were taken by me.</p>
